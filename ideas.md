# Strategy ideas

- Use move that does the most combinations

- What if nothing can be combined?

- Should one direction be preferred (Left over Right)?

- Prefer combinations with high numbers?

- What defines a good move?
1. Combine as many numbers as possible
2. Combine high numbers preferrably (log2 -> square)
