# Strategy ideas

- Use move that does the most combinations

- What if nothing can be combined?

- Should one direction be preferred (Left over Right)?

- Prefer combinations with high numbers?

- What defines a good move?
- patternmatching -> move depending on pattern
-> Multi-Combination (2, 2, 4, 8)
-> Try to align numbers (in row or column)

1. Combine as many numbers as possible
2. Combine high numbers preferrably (log2 -> square)
3. What if nothing can be combined?

Performance measure:
- Time per move
- avg score
